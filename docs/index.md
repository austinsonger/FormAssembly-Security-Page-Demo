## Dedicated Security Team

<!--- __Recommended for:__ >Series A/Series B startups. If you handle sensitive data this hire should probably come as soon as possible. --->

<!--- __Explanation:__ A dedicated team (or employee) shows additional commitment to the security of your data. Add this section if you have at least ½ an employee dedicated to improving the security of your company. Add more information (specific achievements or past roles of your team members) if you think it brings value. --->

<!--- __Customization:__ Minor customization required. --->

Our security team is comprised of security experts dedicated to improving the security of our organization. Our employees are trained on security incident response and are on call 24/7.



## Security Architecture and Operating Model

## Roles, Responsibilities, and Training

## Risk Management

## System Audits, Monitoring and Assessments



### Logging Practices

FormAssembly maintains a robust centralized logging environment where logs are reviewed on a daily basis. Logging is enabled in order to establish a sufficient audit trail for all access. Logging is performed at the application level as well. Automated audit trails are implemented to reconstruct system events and they’re secured, so they cannot be altered in any way. File Integrity Monitoring is monitoring these actions along with several other security controls to ensure we maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all data.

## Human Resources and Personnel Security

### Personnel Security

All FormAssembly employees undergo background checks and privacy and security training. FormAssembly also maintains a comprehensive and regularly updated set of Information Security policies that cover a wide range of best practices for secure workplace procedures. All policies, procedures, and standards are reviewed and approved annually.

## Threat Detection and Prevention

### Web Application Firewall

WAF, Security Groups, and IPtables are configured with deny-by-default policies. FormAssembly’s Web Application Firewall protects your data against common web attacks. We follow OWASP top 10 and SANS top 25 to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data. Access control lists are reviewed throughout the year and any change must go through Change Management.

### Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and IDS Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)

IDS (Intrusion Detection System) and IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) are deployed at FormAssembly to increase network and server security. IDS/IPS monitor traffic and inspect packets for suspicious data. Detection in both systems is mainly based on signatures already detected and recognized. Signatures are updated and alerts are reviewed on a daily basis. Logs are sent to our centralized logger where they are reviewed on an ongoing basis.


## Vulnerability Management

## Mobile Device Security and Storage Media Management

## Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery

## Business Continuity


### Disaster Recovery

FormAssembly has Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity plans in place, and all relevant personnel are apprised of their roles. In the event of a disaster, the FormAssembly Customer Support team will provide a disaster declaration notice to all affected customers. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity plans are tested on an annual basis.

## Incident Response

### Incident Response Policy

FormAssembly has an established Incident Response policy and procedure based on NIST guidelines that activates upon a security breach. In the event of an incident, we will notify you in a timely manner of any unauthorized access to your data. The FormAssembly Incident Response plan is tested annually or as needed.
